## 🧠 About Bubbles

Bubbles: Mind Physics is an interactive, physics-based educational game designed to teach the intellectual standards for critical thinking through engaging gameplay. I built this project specifically for my nephew Ntiska, who has a natural curiosity about how to think better but needed something more engaging than traditional learning methods.

The game uses realistic physics simulations (gravity, momentum, collisions) to create an immersive environment where players can develop critical thinking skills while having fun. Each level introduces a different intellectual standard, challenging players to apply these concepts through innovative gameplay mechanics.


## ✨ Features

- **8 Progressive Levels** - Each teaching one of the fundamental intellectual standards:
  - **Clarity** - Navigate through simple obstacles
  - **Accuracy** - Hit targets with precision
  - **Precision** - Make exact movements
  - **Relevance** - Choose the right tools for the task
  - **Depth** - Navigate through multiple layers
  - **Breadth** - Consider multiple paths
  - **Logic** - Solve problems in the correct sequence
  - **Fairness** - Maintain balance while solving problems

- **Realistic Physics Engine** - Gravity, momentum, bounce effects, and collisions
- **Intuitive Drag-to-Launch Controls** - Easy to learn, satisfying to master
- **Visual Feedback Systems** - Particle effects, animations, and color coding
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor improvement across multiple play sessions
- **Responsive Design** - Play on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support** - Easy on the eyes for extended play sessions

## 🎮 How It Works

The game uses a simple but powerful physics system built with vanilla JavaScript. Players drag and release to launch balls towards targets, navigating through various obstacles that represent barriers to clear thinking. Each level introduces new mechanics that correspond to the intellectual standard being taught.

For example, in the "Relevance" level, players must choose the correct ball (relevant information) to hit the target, while in the "Breadth" level, they need to hit multiple mini-targets (consider multiple perspectives) before reaching the main goal.

## 🚀 Ntiska's Learning Journey

This project was born from preparing my nephew Ntiska for big school. While bright and curious, he found the standard approaches boring and disconnected from his interests. By combining physics-based gameplay (which he loves) with subtle learning objectives, Bubbles has helped him grasp complex thinking concepts without feeling like he's studying.

Ntiska's favorite feature? The confetti explosion when completing a level - a small celebration that reinforces the satisfaction of clear thinking!

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with animations and transitions
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or libraries
- **Custom Physics Engine** - Built from scratch for educational purposes

## 📈 Future Development (Ntiska's Wishlist)

Based on Ntiska's feedback, future versions may include:
- Multiplayer mode for family competition
- Custom level creator
- Additional standards beyond the core eight
- Sound effects and music (his specific request!)
- Achievement system with badges

## 🏆 Acknowledgments
